// Stuck-loop watchdog — fork-only, lives at CalibrationCalc.cpp:~1455-1518.
// Fires `calibration.Clear()` when continuous-cal has been rejecting every
// new sample for ~25 s on a calibration whose prior-error is *above* the
// 5 mm noise floor. Doesn't fire on rejections against an already-healthy
// prior, because rejecting noise IS the correct behavior there.
//
// Decision split into two trivially-testable predicates so the constants
// (rejection cap, healthy floor) are pinned by the test suite. Production
// code in `CalibrationCalc::ComputeIncremental` calls both helpers and
// uses the difference to decide between "skip with healthy-hold annotation"
// and "actually clear."
//
// Per project_watchdog_wedged_cal_limitation.md: this watchdog cannot
// catch wedged-self-consistent calibrations (priorError stays low even
// when the cal is physically wrong). The wedge guard from 8e5e111
// backstops the case the watchdog can't see; this header pins the
// watchdog's healthy-floor boundary so any future tuning is deliberate.
