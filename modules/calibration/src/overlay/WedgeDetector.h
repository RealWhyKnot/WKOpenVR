// Wedge detection — single source of truth for the architectural-wedge case
// described in project_watchdog_wedged_cal_limitation.md (memory).
//
// A wedged calibration is one where the math has converged to a self-consistent
// fit (low error_currentCal, low error_byRelPose, both methods agree) that is
// nonetheless physically wrong — the user's body trackers appear in nonsense
// places, often 2-3 m offset from where they should be. Continuous-cal cannot
// escape it from inside the data because new samples either confirm the wedge
// (so the rejection counter never grows and the watchdog's wedge-recovery
// branch never fires) or are rejected as noise (counter grows but the prior-
// error gate keeps the watchdog asleep).
//
// The fork's previous behaviour was to ship a manual "Recalibrate from
// scratch" button so the user could escape it themselves. The user's
// 2026-05-04 ask: stop expecting users to know to do that — auto-detect, and
// silently auto-recover. This header centralises the bound + the runtime
// debounce-and-fire decision so both the load-time guard (Configuration.cpp,
// ParseProfile) and the runtime detector (Calibration.cpp, CalibrationTick)
// agree on the threshold and the test suite can pin the firing logic.

namespace spacecal::wedge {

// Plausibility bound on the calibration translation magnitude (cm).
// Anything above this on load OR on a sustained runtime tick is treated as
// the wedge case and silently cleared.
//
// Threshold rationale (2026-05-05 update): RAISED from 200 cm to 500 cm
// after a reset-loop incident. The original 200 cm was based on a single
// session log where the user's healthy converged fit was 127 cm. A later
// session showed continuous-cal repeatedly converging to 265-295 cm —
// legitimate values for that user's Quest+Lighthouse setup, where the
// physical origin separation between the two tracking systems IS that
// large. The 200 cm bound caused the runtime detector to fire on every
// natural convergence, producing the user-visible "keeps resetting my
// position over and over" reset loop (3 fires in 3 minutes, log
// `spacecal_log.2026-05-05T03-17-26.txt`).
//
// 500 cm = 5 m: roughly the diagonal of a generous room-scale setup. A
// truly wedged cal jumps far beyond this (the original triggering case
// was 295 cm but that was on the SAME user's setup that now legitimately
// hits 295 cm — so even the original "wedge" may have been mis-classified
// noise). Raising the threshold here trades coverage of small wedges for
// freedom from false positives. The watchdog (CalibrationCalc.cpp) and
// the geometry-shift detector (Calibration.cpp:2098) still backstop
// genuine catastrophic events through other signals.
//
// If a future user reports wedges in the 200-500 cm band that go
// unrecovered, revisit — likely needs a per-setup configuration or a
// disagreement-based detector (currentCal vs byRelPose), not a fixed
// magnitude floor. Don't tighten without checking
// `feedback_dont_break_existing_calibrations.md` AND
// `spacecal_log.2026-05-05T03-17-26.txt`.
constexpr double kMaxPlausibleCalibrationMagnitudeCm = 500.0;

// Runtime debounce window (s). The runtime detector only fires after the
// magnitude has stayed above the bound for this long uninterrupted —
// prevents single-tick numerical glitches (rare-but-possible during normal
// continuous-cal operation) from spuriously clobbering a healthy calibration.
// 30 s is well above any healthy-fresh-start hunting window (which spikes at
// 8–12 cm, nowhere near 200 cm), so there is no false-positive concern; the
// only purpose is single-tick filtering.

// Returns true exactly once per wedge episode, when the magnitude has been
// above the bound for at least kRuntimeWedgeDebounceSec consecutive seconds.
// On a fire, resets `wedgeSince` to the sentinel so a subsequent call won't
// re-fire until magnitude drops back under the bound and re-climbs.
//
// Returns false when:
//   - magnitude is at or below the bound (and resets wedgeSince to sentinel)
//   - magnitude is above the bound but the debounce window hasn't elapsed
//
// `now` is glfwGetTime() seconds in production; tests pass synthetic times.
